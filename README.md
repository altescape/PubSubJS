# Mine own Pub/Sub

Based on some other versions of pubsub methodology, this is a simplified, cut-down version for use in node apps primarily, but can be used anywhere really.

I'm using it in a React app where several unrelated components need to message each other. Just plugged in with `import PubSub from './pubsub'`
